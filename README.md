# Inventory Management System with MySQL (C++)

Welcome to the **Inventory Management System** project! This application integrates with a **MySQL database** to manage an inventory system where you can **add, view, search, and delete products**. Built using **C++**, it connects to MySQL for persistent data storage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following software installed:

### 1. **MySQL Server**  
MySQL is required to store and manage your product data.  
- **Download MySQL Server**:  
  [Download MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

### 2. **C++ Compiler (MinGW or GCC)**  
To compile and run the C++ code, you'll need a C++ compiler.  
- **Download MinGW**:  
  [Download MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)  
- **Download GCC for Windows**:  
  [Download GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

### 3. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
Visual Studio Code is an IDE that makes writing and compiling C++ code easy.  
- **Download VS Code**:  
  [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Necessary VS Code Extensions**:  
1. **C/C++ Extension**: By Microsoft for C++ support.  
2. **MySQL (optional)**: For managing MySQL databases inside VS Code.

### 4. **MySQL Connector for C++**  
You'll need the **MySQL Connector/C++** to connect C++ with MySQL.  
- **Download MySQL Connector**:  
  [Download MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install MySQL

1. **Download and Install MySQL Server** from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
2. **Create the `inventory` Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE inventory;
   Create the products Table:
   CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price DOUBLE NOT NULL
   );

**Step 2:** Install and Set Up MinGW or GCC
Download MinGW from the MinGW SourceForge page.
Install it and add the bin directory to your system PATH so that g++ is accessible from the command line.

**Step 3:** Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Download and Install VS Code from here.
Install the C/C++ Extension by Microsoft to provide support for C++ development.



**Step 4:** Install MySQL Connector/C++
Download MySQL Connector for C++ from the official MySQL website.

Make sure the include and lib directories are correctly set in your project for proper linking.

**Step 5:** Configure VS Code for Building the Project
1. Include Path Configuration
To set up the MySQL Connector include path, modify the c_cpp_properties.json file in VS Code:
"includePath": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/**",
    "C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/include"
];

2. Library Path Configuration
Configure the library path in the tasks.json file in VS Code:
```{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "g++",
            "args": [
                "-g",
                "inventory.cpp",
                "-o",
                "inventory",
                "-I\"C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/include\"",
                "-L\"C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/lib\"",
                "-lmysqlclient"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "problemMatcher": ["$gcc"],
            "detail": "Generated task by VS Code"
        }
    ]
}
